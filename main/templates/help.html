    <h1>Compass Automation (compauto) Documentation</h1>
    <p>
        Tired of the manual process of writing in to request for a sales opportunity appeal? Fret not because this
        application is going to automate this menial process. This app will also make the life of those who need to
        approve the appeal easier by consolidating all request in one application. Win-win for both parties!
    </p>
    <p>
        Read on for the documentation of this application.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview of the Application</h2>
    <p>
        This application is meant to automate the manual process of sales opoortunity appeal. What is normally done
        through paper or email will be replaced by an eForm that can be submitted by a banker through this application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workflow is as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="card card-body bg-info" style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Banker &rarr; Team Lead &rarr; Team Manager &rarr; Sales Head &rarr; Approval &check;</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A banker will complete the eForms to submit their appeal request.</li>
        <li>The system will record the appeal request on the database.</li>
        <li>A team lead requests for the pending appeal request and approves it.</li>
        <li>The system will record the approval by team lead and reflects it accordingly (red).</li>
        <li>A team manager requests for the appeal request approved by the team lead and approves it.</li>
        <li>The system will record the approval by team manager and reflects it accordingly (yellow).</li>
        <li>A sales head requests for the appeal request approved by the team manager and approves it.</li>
        <li>The system will finally approve the request completely (green) and change the opportunity database.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For Banker</h2>
    <p><strong>Main Use Case: </strong>To submit sales opportunity appeal</p>
    <p>
        When you first log in, you will be redirected to the homepage. You can fill up the eForm here to raise an
        appeal. The homepage also shows some automatically generated information that should be reflected correctly
        if the administrator creates the account successfully. Any discrepancy please report to the administrator -
        only the administrator can make changes to the account details!
    </p>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-header">Filling up the eForms</h3>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
            <li>
                Use the CRM Application Number verifier to check if the data that you have input is indeed valid. If
                the number exists in the database, it will show the details of the opportunity - which will act as a
                good visual check if you have input the correct number. Otherwise, if the number does not exist in the
                database, the app will give a warning that you have input an invalid CRM Application number.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have successfully verified the CRM Application Number, it will be automatically be copied into
                the form that you would need to complete, saving you the effort of typing twice.
            </li>
            <li>
                The staff number and staff ID are also linked based on the user database. If there is any discrepancy,
                please rectify the issue with the administrator, requesting for a change in account details.
            </li>
            </ul>

    <h2>For Team Lead, Team Manager and Sales Head</h2>
    <p><strong>Main Use Case: </strong>To approve sales opportunity appeal</p>
    <p>
        Similar to a banker, when you first log in, you will be redirected to a homepage where you can check the
        automatically generated details. Clarify with the administrator if there is any discrepancies! The difference
        between a banker and a team lead/team manager/sales head account is that a banker can raise an appeal, while
        a team lead/team manager/sales head cannot raise any appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Proceed to the dashboard to approve an appeal instead. This dashboard is not visible to any bankers.
    </p>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-header">Approving an Appeal Request</h3>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
            <li>
                Since all requests have gone through CRM Application Number verification, it is guaranteed that the
                requests listed here reference a valid opportunity in the database.
            </li>
            <li>
                A request will be reflected as a row in the table. A row can have four colours: white, red, yellow,
                green - each corresponding to how far is each request at in terms of approval.
                <ul>
                    <li>White represents untouched requests: <strong>team lead</strong> needs to approve these.</li>
                    <li>Red represents requests that were approved by team lead: <strong>team manager</strong> needs to approve these next.</li>
                    <li>Yellow represents requests that were approved by team manager: <strong>sales head</strong> needs to approve these next.</li>
                    <li>Green represents requests that were approved by sales head: these requests are <strong>completely approved</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                It is impossible to deviate from the workflow, which means that if the team lead has not approve the
                request, it is not possible for the team manager or sales head to approve the request in advance. This
                is important to ensure that there is an organised workflow. <strong>This also means that once a sales
                head approves the request, changes are final!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                This is also where the team stored in the database becomes very important. Team lead can only approve
                requests from bankers within his or her team. Basically, no cross-approval is allowed. If there is no
                team assigned, an error will be raised - indicating that there is a problem on the administrator side.
                Do contact the administrator if you encounter any problem with the allocation of teams.
            </li>

    <h2>For Administrator</h2>
    <p><strong>Main Use Case: </strong>To create and manage accounts</p>
    <p>
        You should also be able to see your details in the homepage when you log in. However, the details here should
        be rather standard. In fact, it should be correct as it is impossible to change any details regarding an
        administrator account for safety reason.
    </p>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-header">Managing Accounts</h3>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
            <li>
                As an administrator, you should be able to execute three basic functions: to <strong>add</strong>,
                <strong>edit</strong>, and <strong>delete</strong> user accounts. The edit and delete buttons are
                placed in the table, so you can simply click on the row corresponding to the user you wish to edit or
                delete.
            </li>
            <li>
                As an administrator, you can also define "relationships" - which is important for the workflow as only
                leaders of the team would be able to approve a certain request. For example, if a request is raised by
                a banker from Raffles Place team, only the team lead of Raffles Place team can approve it, not the
                Orchard team.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you fail to define all relationships possible, some staff may not be able to approve requests
                        as they are supposed to, so you may be alerted of some problems by the staff.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                You can still access the request dashboard for monitoring purpose, but you cannot approve any request.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
